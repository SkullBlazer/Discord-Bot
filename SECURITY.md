## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

# Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
# reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
# declined, etc.

To report a vulnerability, DM me in Discord to SkullBlazer#9339.

If the vulnerability is valid, you will receive 100,000 SlaveBot currency.

Else, I will take 100,000 SlaveBot currency from you :)
